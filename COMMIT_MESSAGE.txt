feat: Tool integration with command system and palette updates (Step 2 complete)

Update drawing tools to create undoable commands and add additional color palettes
to complete Step 2 of Milestone 2.

### Tool Integration:
- Updated BrushTool to create CellCommand instances instead of direct modifications
- Updated EraserTool to create undoable erase operations
- Updated PickerTool for consistency (no commands needed as it doesn't modify scene)
- All drawing operations now go through the command system for undo/redo support
- Command merging works for continuous brush/eraser strokes

### Technical Changes:
- Tools now receive CommandHistory reference for creating commands
- Commands automatically execute and get added to history
- Proper coordinate conversion between index and x,y formats
- Full integration with existing StateManager event system
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Palette Additions:
- Added "Dusty" color palette for additional theming options
- Expanded color palette selection for better visual variety

### Files Modified:
- src/tools/BrushTool.js: Command-based painting operations
- src/tools/EraserTool.js: Command-based erasing operations
- src/tools/PickerTool.js: Updated for consistency
- src/palettes.json: Added new color palettes
- tests/BrushTool.test.js: Updated for command system integration
- tests/EraserTool.test.js: Updated for command system integration

### Testing:
- All 599 tests passing
- Tool integration tests updated for command system
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Command merging verified for continuous operations

### Success Criteria Met:
✅ Brush creates undoable commands
✅ Eraser creates undoable commands
✅ Continuous brush stroke = single undo step
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ All existing tests passing

Completes Step 2: Tool Integration with Commands
Ready for grid resize infrastructure in Step 4
